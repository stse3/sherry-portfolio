                <h2>What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>
                <p>Despite Uber’s 23 million daily riders and network of 5.4 million drivers worldwide, one of the
                    growing firm’s biggest challenges is accessibility.</p>

                <h2><bold>Our Solution: </bold>Uber Learn</h2>
                <p>Uber Learn will serve as a training platform for new Uber drivers, offering mandatory modules taken
                    in order to complete their Uber driver registration, alongside optional modules for drivers wishing to
                    partake in specific Uber programs such as UberPet and Uber WAV</p>

                <h2>Impact Projection</h2>
                <p>Uber Learn can be expanded to cater towards all Uber services and specific niches—for example,
                    relevant education or training for Uber Eats or Uber Health drivers. Through Uber Learn’s new
                    service, we hope to improve the experience of both drivers and riders alike.
                    Creating a program for drivers can also substantially improve the satisfaction of our riders. Not only
                    that, training removes the barrier of trustability and assures new riders that they will be in good
                    hands. Such additional certifications can be denoted by Uber’s existing driver profiles, or alternate
                    icons within the app to inform riders of the driver’s training</p>
                <p>Through this comparative advantage, Uber would reliably have access to the
                    accessible-rideshare market, a substantial 27% of the American population (Centre for Disease
                    Control, 2021).</p>
